Key Steps Taken in the Project:
Set Up Git Repository:

Initialized a Git repository in a project folder.
Set up a remote repository for version control and tracking changes.
Branch Creation & Conflict Simulation:

Created two separate branches from the master branch.
Made conflicting changes in the same function of the source code in both branches.
Merged branch1 into the master branch successfully.
Simulated a merge conflict by trying to merge branch2 into the master branch, resulting in a merge conflict.
Merge Conflict Resolution:

Used KDiff3 as the merge tool to visually compare and resolve the conflicts in the code.
Configured Git to use KDiff3 as the default merge tool.
Ran git mergetool to launch KDiff3 and resolve the conflicts manually.
Resolved the conflicts and saved the merged version of the file.
Git Commit & Push:

After resolving the conflicts, committed the changes to the repository.
Pushed the resolved code to the remote repository.
